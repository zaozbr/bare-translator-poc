Bare Translator PoC: Usage DocumentationThis document outlines the steps to install, run, and verify the Bare Translator Proof of Concept. This PoC validates the critical technical path: retrieving a "Mock AI Model" (JSON data) from a decentralized P2P Hyperdrive using the Bare runtime.1. PrerequisitesBefore running the application, ensure the following are installed on your machine:Node.js & NPM: Download herePear Runtime (Global):npm install -g pear
2. InstallationNavigate to the project root folder (bare-translator-poc).Install the required P2P dependencies (Hyperswarm, Hyperdrive, Corestore):npm install
3. Running the PoCThis simulation requires two separate terminal windows to represent two distinct nodes on the network: the Seeder (Hosting the Model) and the App (Consuming the Model).Step 1: Start the Seeder (The "Backend")The Seeder creates the P2P Drive and writes the mock data file (model.json) to it.Open Terminal A.Run the seeder script:pear run seeder.js
Action: Wait for the initialization to complete. The terminal will output a Drive Key (a long hexadecimal string).Example: e9a1b2c3d4...Copy this key. You will need it for the app.Step 2: Start the App (The "User")The App is the frontend interface that will download the model.Open Terminal B.Run the application in development mode:pear run --dev .
A window labeled "Bare Translator (PoC)" will appear.4. Usage & VerificationNow that both nodes are running, follow these steps to verify the P2P connection and "Translation" logic.Connect:In the App window, paste the Drive Key (copied from Terminal A) into the input field.Click Connect.Observation: You may notice a slight delay while the App searches the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for the Seeder. The status will change to "Model Loaded successfully via P2P!".Translate:Once connected, the translation UI appears.Type one of the mock supported words: hello, world, or team.Click Translate.Result: The app should return the Spanish equivalent (hola, mundo, equipo).Test Offline Mode (Optional):After the model is loaded, disconnect your internet.Try translating another word.Result: It should still work, proving the model was successfully downloaded to the local device.5. TroubleshootingStuck on "Looking for peers...":Ensure both terminals are running.If on a corporate network, firewalls may block P2P connections. Try running both terminals on a standard home WiFi or mobile hotspot."Error loading model":Verify you copied the key exactly.Restart the seeder.js process to generate a fresh key and try again.
